##Intelligent Robot Systems 

This code was created in order to allow for experimentation, towards developing specific modules of an autonomous simulated vehicle that performs full exploration **and coverage** of an unknown a priori environment. Next, you can find instructions on how to setup the code in your PC / laptop, the description of the code, as well as the challenges.
